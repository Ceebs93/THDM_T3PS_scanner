# Presented at Moriond 2013.
# Data extracted from the mu plot at 125 GeV, based on the MVA result.
# This measurement and the associated category measurements were not performed
# at the best-fit mass of 125.4GeV. 
# However, we still want to implement the mass measurement of
# 125.4 +- 0.5(stat) +- 0.6(syst) GeV.
