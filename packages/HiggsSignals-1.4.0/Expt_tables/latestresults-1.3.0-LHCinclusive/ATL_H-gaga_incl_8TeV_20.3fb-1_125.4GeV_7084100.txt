# This observables should not be used together with the category measurements!!!
#
# They analyze 7 and 8 TeV but only present combined mu's for both.
# We here assume only 8 TeV and the 8 TeV luminosity.
# The signal strengths is measured at mH = 125.4 GeV. This peak observable
# carries the mass measurement of 125.98 +- 0.50 GeV presented in
# arXiv:1406.3827 from the H->gammagamma channel.
