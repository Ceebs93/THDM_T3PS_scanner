# Should not be used together with category measurements!
# Signal measured at 125.7GeV, but
# best-fit mass implemented here is 125.63 +- 0.45.
#
# NOTE: No mass measurement comes with this observable, since the ATLAS H->gamma gamma
# observable (201500711) includes the ATLAS+CMS combined mass observable!
