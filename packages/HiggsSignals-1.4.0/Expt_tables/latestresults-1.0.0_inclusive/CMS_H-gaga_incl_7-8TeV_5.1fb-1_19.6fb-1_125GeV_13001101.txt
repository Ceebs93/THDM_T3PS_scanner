# Presented at Moriond 2013.
# Data extracted from the mu plot at 125 GeV, based on the MVA result.
# This measurement and the associated category measurements were not performed
# at the best-fit mass of 125.4GeV. Therefore, instead of using the quoted
# error of +- 0.5(stat) +- 0.6(syst) GeV, we chose conservatively a mass resolution
# of 1.5GeV.
