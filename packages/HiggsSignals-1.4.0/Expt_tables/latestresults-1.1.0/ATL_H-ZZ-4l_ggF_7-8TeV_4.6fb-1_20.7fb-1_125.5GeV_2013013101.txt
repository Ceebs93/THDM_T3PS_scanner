# Data is taken from Fig. 6 in arXiv:1307.1427 named "other categories".
# The measurement was performed at mH=125.5GeV.
# In order to provide the possibility of using also the mass measurement
# of the H->ZZ channel, we implement this observable at the 124.3 GeV.
# Mass uncertainty contains 0.6 GeV (stat) and 0.5 GeV (syst) error.
