# Data extracted from the mu plot in Fig 17 of arXiv:1408.7084
# aka ATLAS-HIGG-2013-08 aka CERN-PH-EP-2014-198
# They analyze 7 and 8 TeV but only present combined mu's for both.
# We here assume only 8 TeV and the 8 TeV luminosity.
# The signal strengths is measured at mH = 125.4 GeV. This peak observable
# carries the mass measurement of 125.98 +- 0.50 GeV presented in
# arXiv:1406.3827 from the H->gammagamma channel.
