# WARNING: This observable should not be used with
# ATL_H-ZZ-4l_7-8TeV_4.5fb-1_20.3fb-1_124.51GeV_5191101.txt
# simultaneously (same ID and similar data)!
#
# Data is taken from Eq.6 in arXiv:1408.5191 for mu(ggF+bbH+ttH).
# The measurement was performed at mH=125.36GeV.
# In order to provide the possibility of using also the mass measurement
# of the H->ZZ channel, we implement this observable at the 124.51+-0.52 GeV.
# Mass uncertainty contains 0.6 GeV (stat) and 0.5 GeV (syst) error.
