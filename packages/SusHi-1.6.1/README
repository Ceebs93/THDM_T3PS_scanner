INSTALLATION AND USAGE:
1. To use SusHi, type "./configure"
  or "./configure F77FLAGS=..." if additional compiler
  flags are necessary.
  The script looks for the ifort or gfortran compiler
  and relevant directories/libraries.
  If you want to use a different compiler, please
  specify the corresponding variables/paths
  in the compilerissues.

2. Please adjust the paths to a compiled version of
  LHAPDF in the Makefile and, if requested, to compiled
  versions of FeynHiggs/2HDMC/HiggsBounds/HiggsSignals.

3. Type "make" or
   for the MSSM
   for linking SusHi to FeynHiggs(FH)      "make predef=FH" or
   for linking SusHi to HiggsBounds(HB)+FH "make predef=HB" or
   for linking SusHi to HiggsSignals+HB+FH "make predef=HS" or
   for the 2HDM
   for linking SusHi to 2HDMC              "make predef=2HDMC".

4. Go to the "/bin" directory and run SusHi by
   typing "./sushi inputfile.in outputfile.out".
   Example inputfiles can be found in the folder
   "/example".

CHANGELOG:

2016.08.08: V 1.6.1: Minor improvements and bug fixes.
- Improvements for what concerns the numerical integrations.
- Bug in the qg- and qqbar-channel for pseudorapidity cuts fixed.
  The numerical effects are small.
- Bug in the qqbar-channel for simultaneous pt- and rapidity-cuts fixed.
  Impact on the cross section is small.
- Correction of an error in the perturbative running
  of DIM5 operators, minor effects on cross sections
  (thanks to Johannes Michel).
- Compatibility with FeynHiggs 2.12.0.

2016.05.12: V 1.6.0:
New features for the gluon fusion cross section:
Soft expansion, N^3LO contributions, 1/m_t^n terms at NNLO
Matching to high-energy limit, Analytic renormalization
scale variation, Dimension-5 operators
New processes: Higgs production in the annihilation of heavy quarks
- The new developments in V 1.6.0 are described in:
  ------------------------------------------
  SusHi Bento: Beyond NNLO and the heavy-top limit
  Robert V. Harlander, Stefan Liebler, Hendrik Mantler
  [arXiv:1605.03190]
  ------------------------------------------
- Implementation of soft expansion (1-x)^n around the threshold
  of Higgs production x=M_H^2/s at NLO, NNLO and N^3LO
  in the heavy-top limit.
- Implementation of N^3LO contributions to gluon fusion using the
  previously mentioned soft expansion in the heavy-top limit.
- Implementation of 1/m_t^n terms to NLO and NNLO contributions
  in the heavy-top limit. Matching to the exact
  result in the limit x->0 is possible at NLO, NNLO and N^3LO.
- Implementation of dimension-5 operators including perturbative
  and resummed running. They can be added to all Higgs bosons
  of the supported models.
- SusHi calculates the annihilation cross section of arbitrary
  quarks up to NNLO, see:
  ------------------------------------------
  Higgs production in heavy quark annihilation through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD
  Robert V. Harlander
  [arXiv:1512.04901]
  ------------------------------------------
  Also pT distributions are available at lowest order.
- SusHi performs a renormalization scale (muR) variation within a single
  run. Results for different muR are provided in an additional output file.
  The maximal and minimal deviation, serving as an estimate of the
  theoretical error on the cross section, is given in the usual output file.
- Changed *CONVENTIONS* for pseudoscalar mass matrix to fit SLHA
  in the NMSSM:
  The Goldstone moved to the last position in the vector of mass
  eigenstates, such that the ordering is now (A,S,G).
- Corrected a bug in the squark contributions to pseudoscalar
  Higgs production, minor effects for m_{A_i} > 2*m_t (thanks
  to Alessio Agostini).
- Version numbers of the external codes (FeynHiggs, 2HDMC, etc.)
  are written to the block "SUSHIinfo" in the output file.

2015.03.01: V 1.5.0 (R361):
New model NMSSM! Added Block BBHREWEIGHT with effective couplings.
Correction of minor issues related to the squark mixing angle in evalcsusy
and the read in of negative soft-breaking masses.
Specification of stop and sbottom sector by user.
- SusHi allows to calculate Higgs cross sections for the NMSSM.
  For details we refer to:
  ------------------------------------------
  Neutral Higgs production at proton colliders in the CP-conserving NMSSM
  Stefan Liebler
  [arXiv:1502.07972]
  ------------------------------------------
  In contrast to the MSSM/2HDM we do not provide a direct link
  to a spectrum generator, but the NMSSM Higgs spectrum has to
  be specified in the input file, see /example.
- The output block BBHREWEIGHT provided for the MSSM/2HDM/NMSSM
  allows to extract the relevant couplings for reweighting
  SM cross sections for bottom-quark associated production.
- evalcsusy accepts also squark mixing angles with cos(theta_q)<0
  (thanks to Pietro Slavich and Alessio Agostini).
- SusHi accepts negative soft-breaking masses in the stop and
  sbottom sector (thanks to Tim Stefaniak).
- The input files *_MASS.in provided for the NMSSM and MSSM
  in the folder /example allow to specify the stop and sbottom
  sector explicitly. The user is however asked to pay attention
  to the employed default renormalization scheme (see SusHi manual).

2014.11.05: V 1.4.1 (R343):
Cross section calculations for large SUSY masses.
Adding FeynHiggs flags to input and output.
Changing convention for 2HDM type 3 and 4.
- SusHi now provides reasonable cross sections also for large SUSY masses.
- The FeynHiggs flags can be added to the input and are always
  part of the output. This in particular allows to adjust
  the flag 'looplevel' to value 3 for large SUSY masses.
- CORRECTION OF A BUG (thanks to CMS and ATLAS!):
  The link of SusHi to 2HDMC in case of the 2HDM types
  'lepton-specific' and 'flipped' was wrong, in detail
  the two types were interchanged in the link. Now,
  type 3 always denotes the 'flipped' scenario and
  type 4 the 'lepton-specific' scenario. The 2HDM type 
  conventions within SusHi therefore changed! Manual, example files
  and webpage are updated accordingly.

2014.10.07: V 1.4.0 (R335): Compatibility with LHAPDF 6.
Cross section calculations up to sqrt(s)=100TeV.
Links to HiggsBounds and HiggsSignals.
Small corrections in the output.
- SusHi is now compatible with LHAPDF 6.
- Small bug fixes allow for cross section calculations up to 100TeV.
- SusHi now allows to link to HiggsSignals and HiggsBounds
  in case of the MSSM. Accordingly the links to compiled
  versions of HiggsBounds or HiggsSignals have to be
  provided in HBPATH/HSPATH in the Makefile.
  Afterwards type "make" together with "predef=HB" or "HS".
  Make sure that HB/HS were compiled with the same compiler.
  For now, the input of HB/HS is based on the XS calculations of FH.

2014.04.03: V 1.3.0 (R321): Implementation of
NNLO stop contributions for H/A.
Allowance of different PDF set numbers. Bug fixes.
- Implementation of NNLO stop contributions for h/H/A
  in accordance to arXiv:1404.0327.
- If 2HDMC entry 10 set to 1, SusHi aborts if one of
  the 2HDMC checks on unitarity, stability, perturbativity fails.
- Allow separate PDF set number at LO, NLO, NNLO
  by specifying entries 11 (LO), 12 (NLO), 13 (NNLO) in Block PDFSPEC.
  If entry 4 is given, all these entries will be overridden.
- Bug fixes for factors\neq 1 in the SM, scale choices
  of muR and muF within ggh@nnlo (minor effects on XS obtained
  with previous versions in case of muR\neq \muF),
  correction of upper cuts on p_T/eta (induces large
  differences).
- Cleanup of the code.
- If SusHi needs to be compiled with additional compiler flags,
  you may provide them by typing "./configure F77FLAGS= ...".
- cch production can be calculated in analogy to bbh production.
  For more details of this option get in contact with the authors.

2014.01.13: V 1.2.0 (R296): Implementation of different
ggh/bbh scales and more detailled VEGAS input. Output
of ggh@nnlo subprocesses.
- SusHi allows the choice of different renormalization
and factorization scales for ggh and bbh. Accordingly all
example inputfiles are updated.
- VEGAS parameters can be specified independently for
the NLO SusHi calculations, the ggh@nnlo and bbh@nnlo calls.
- Setting entry 20 of SUSHI to 10 the various subprocesses
of ggh@nnlo are printed. Entry 19 allows to reduce the
screen output of SusHi.
- Cleanup of the Makefile and the code.

2013.09.27: V 1.1.1 (R259): Inclusion of a link to 2HDMC.
Support of FeynHiggs 2.9.5.
- SusHi now contains a link to 2HDMC. For using it, please
  type "make predef=2HDMC" and run one of the input files
  "2HDMC_xxx.in" provided in the "/example" folder.
  ------------------------------------------
  2HDMC - Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Calculator
  D. Eriksson, J. Rathsman, O. StÃ¥l
  Comput.Phys.Commun.181:189-205 (2010)
  [arXiv:0902.0851]
  ------------------------------------------
- SusHi supports FeynHiggs 2.9.5. Please provide the
  FeynHiggs version in "FHVERSION" in the Makefile.
- Added more warnings related to fixed order p_T distributions.

2013.04.30: V 1.1.0 (R242): Reorganization of the output.
Inclusion of a reference list. Correction of a bug in bottom-quark
annihilation. Expansion of counterterms of stop contributions
for heavy Higgs. Deletion of obsolete routines. Difference in
the Makefile. Input value of SM Higgs mass changed.
- The output was reorganized. The input file is not simply attached,
  but completely reprocessed for the output file. In addition
  BLOCK SCALESOUT was replaced by BLOCK ALPHASOUT, which does
  not contain redundant information. The relevant SCALES can
  be found in the reprocessed input file. Moreover the output file
  contains a list of references to all relevant codes and formulas
  being input to SusHi for the specific run. Please cite the
  listed references.
- Bug in the calculation of bottom-quark annihilation fixed.
  The old version was valid only for mu_F = mu_R.
- Expansion of counterterms in mt for stop contributions in case of
  the heavy Higgs. Effects for very large gluino masses/
  very low SUSY spectrum (thanks to Emanuele Bagnaschi and Pietro Slavich).
- Input value "1" in Block "MASS" changed to "25" for SM Higgs mass.
- Some obsolete routines were deleted.
- DIFFERENCE IN THE MAKEFILE:
  FOR LINKING SUSHI TO FEYNHIGGS TYPE "make predef=FH"!

2013.04.02: V 1.0.6 (R226): Electroweak corrections for distributions added.
Extension of the electroweak grid. Certain distributions and cuts disabled
in case of numerical instabilities. Speed improvements by some percent.
- Assuming complete factorization electroweak corrections
  by light quarks can now be added to gluon fusion distributions
  and cross sections with cuts.
- The electroweak grid by light quarks is extended to Higgs
  masses between 20 GeV and 1.5 TeV.
- Some combinations of cuts and distributions leading to
  numerical instabilities are not allowed anymore.
- A bug in the call of PDF member sets different than 0 is corrected.
- More efficient calls of dilogarithms lead to speed improvments
  of some percent.

2013.03.13: V 1.0.5 (R218): Significant speed improvements.
Changes in MSSM XS without FeynHiggs usage.
- Significant speed improvements by 30-40 percent. Cross sections
  might be slightly different, but within the numerical error.
- A bug in the calculation of MSSM cross sections without 
  the usage of FeynHiggs (e.g. MSSM_SLHA.in) is corrected.
  Changes in XS mostly at permil level (except sin(2thetab)
  is small). (thanks to Alexandre Arbey)
- For MSSM-SLHA input files and 2HDM input files the input
  value 26 in block "MASS" is changed to 35 for the heavy
  Higgs mass in accordance to SLHA standard.

2013.02.22: V 1.0.4 (R200): Differences in pt distributions.
Speed improvements. FeynHiggs input extended.
- Different SUSY breaking masses and trilinear couplings
  for FeynHiggs can be specified.
- The program prints an error when asked to calculate
  a pT-distribution at LO (in our notation NLO is the first order
  at which a nontrivial pT-distribution occurs).
- When a pT-distribution is calculated, the renormalization and
  factorisation scale can now be set to "sqrt(mh^2+pT^2)"
  rather than "mh". Set Block "SCALES 3" to "1".
- Improvements within the code and a new algorithm for the
  real dilogarithm (from HqT) shortens the running time slightly. 

2013.02.08: V 1.0.3 (R186): 2HDM improvements.
- 2-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) now in accordance
  to arxiv:1106.0034, Table 1+2 (=arXiv:1207.4835, Table 2+3).
  Different types can be distinguished by "Block 2HDM" in the
  input file "/example/in2HDM.in". For SusHi it yields type I=III
  and II=IV, since the lepton couplings are irrelevant.
  Correction of bbh cross section for the 2HDM.
- Initialization of PDFs optimized.

2013.01.30: V 1.0.2 (R180): 2HDM added. No changes in XS.
- 2-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) added. Example input and
  output file in folder /example.
- Example input and output file for mhmax scenario
  with LHC Higgs XS working group parameters added.
- Heavy Higgs mass input parameter added
  (relevant for in2HDM.in and inMSSM_SLHA.in).
- Compiler errors on some machines fixed.

2013.01.08: V 1.0.1 (R170): Minor changes.
- Example output files added.
- Correction of a reweighting factor for the sbottom NLO QCD
  contributions to pseudoscalar Higgs production in the MSSM,
  minimal effect.
- Correction of PDF usage for LO gluon fusion cross section:
  If bbh was asked at higher order, the NLO/NNLO PDF set
  was used accidentially for the LO ggh cross section as well.
  Now the specified LO PDF set is used instead.

2012.12.14: V 1.0.0 (R164): Initial release.
