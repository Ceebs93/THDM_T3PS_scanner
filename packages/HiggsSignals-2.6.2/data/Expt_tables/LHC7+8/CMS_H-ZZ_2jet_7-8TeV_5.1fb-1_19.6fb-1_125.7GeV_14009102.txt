# Published Summer 2014. Data is taken from CMS-PAS-HIG 14-009:
# https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/Hig14009TWiki
# Mass resolution set to 2GeV. Mass measurement does not
# enter the mass chi^2.
# The assignment is linked to 0/1jet result (14009101), 
# which holds the mass observable.
# Efficiencies are chosen such that we have about 30% VBF.
