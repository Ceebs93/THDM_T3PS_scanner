# HiggsSignals-2

HiggsSignals performs a statistical test of the Higgs sector predictions of
arbitrary models with the measurements of Higgs boson signal rates and masses
from the Tevatron and the LHC.

**Looking for the newest [release] or the [documentation]?**

The input routines are documented in the [HiggsBounds] [documentation][hbdoc] and [manual][hbmanual].

HiggsSignals relies on [HiggsBounds] for input, so please also cite the
references listed there.

## Installation

HiggsBounds requires a Fortran compiler supporting at least Fortran 95 (like
`gfortran`), `cmake` as well as [HiggsBounds]. HiggsBounds has to be available
on the system in compiled form. Its location will be automatically found by
CMake. If you have several versions of HiggsBounds installed, set the
`HiggsBounds_DIR` environment variable to the build folder of the version you
want to use before calling `cmake`.

The code is compiled by 
  
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

If your distribution does not provide a recent version of CMake (e.g. Scientific
Linux or CentOS) simply grab the binary version from [here][cmake-download].

If you wish to use a different Fortran compiler set the `FC` environment
variable before running `cmake`.

### Tests
A test suite that checks the results of the example codes against reference
values is included and can be executed through `make check` or (for more
detailed results) `ctest --output-on-failure`. Running the tests requires
`python>3.5` with the `pytest`, `numpy` and `pandas` packages. The test suite
takes a few minutes to complete.


### FeynHiggs examples
Some of the `example_programs` illustrate the use of HiggsSignals together with
[FeynHiggs]. To use these a compiled version of FeynHiggs is required and the
path to the FeynHiggs folder has to specified by adding

    -DFeynHiggs_ROOT=/path/to/feynhiggs

to the `cmake ..` line. See e.g. `example_programs/HBandHSwithFH.F90` for an
example.

## Usage

Compilation generates a binary which can be invoked from the command line as 
	
	./HiggsSignals <options>

and the library

	libHS.a

which can be linked to other codes to use the subroutine interface (see
`src/HiggsSignals_subroutines.F90`). If your project builds using CMake you can simply use
```cmake
find_package(HiggsBounds)
find_package(HiggsSignals)
# ...
target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE HiggsBounds::HB HiggsSignals::HS)
```
and CMake will take care of everything else.

### C Interface
HiggsSignals provides a C interface in `include/HiggsSignals.h` that wraps the
most important Fortran subroutines and takes care of type conversions. When
using the interface, make sure to also link any libraries required by the
Fortran C interface of your compiler setup (e.g. `-lgfortran -lm -lquadmath -lm`
for gcc-gfortran). If you use CMake this will be done automatically.
