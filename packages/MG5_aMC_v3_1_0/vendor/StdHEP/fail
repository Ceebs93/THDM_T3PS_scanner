A compilation Error occurs when trying to compile /mainfs/scratch/cb27g11/THDM_T3PS_scanner/packages/MG5_aMC_v3_1_0/vendor/StdHEP.
The compilation fails with the following output message:
    test -d ./bin || mkdir -p ./bin
    test -d ./lib || mkdir -p ./lib
    (cd mcfio/src; make  all) > log.mcfio.$$ 2>&1
    (cd src/stdhep; make  all) > log.stdhep.$$ 2>&1
    make: *** [stdhep] Error 2
    
Please try to fix this compilations issue and retry.
