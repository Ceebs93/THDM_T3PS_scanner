fastjet-config does not seem to correspond to a valid fastjet-config executable (v3+). We will use fjcore instead.
 Please set the 'fastjet'variable to the full (absolute) /PATH/TO/fastjet-config (including fastjet-config).

lhapdf-config does not seem to correspond to a valid lhapdf-config executable.
