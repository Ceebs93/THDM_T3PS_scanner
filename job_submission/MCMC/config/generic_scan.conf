# >a finite list of numeric values,
# >a list with an ellipsis in the middle i.e. "1, 1.2, ..., 2"
# >an interval i.e. interval(1, 2) with count=5
# >or a definition of a range with a Gaussian distribution i.e.
# "normalvariate(mu, sigma)"
# Please refer to the manual for further details on these methods.

# - Variables
# This section is used when the user wishes to calculate a variable to be used
# inside T3PS. This involves specifying a formula which can only depend on 
# constants and parameters given in this file. Should there be an error (e.g.
# division by zero) in a point it will be discarded. See manual for further
# details.

# - Data
# These are the names of the variables we wish to read the output data into
